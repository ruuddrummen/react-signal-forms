# React Signal Forms

> **Note.** This library is brand new and under heavy development. We're only just getting started.

A forms library which aims to provide a high performance modular and extensible forms experience by leveraging the power of signals with [@preact/signals-react](https://github.com/preactjs/signals).

- Lightweight to develop both simple and large complex forms.
- Only calculates and renders what is necessary by leveraging signals.
- Bring your own UI libraries and components.
- Easy to use, easy to extend. Built from the ground with an DX friendly extension model.
  - Pick and choose what you need.
  - Plug in your own.
- And many more smart and useful quotes.

## Getting started (soon)

To get started install the package with npm:

```
npm install react-signal-forms
```

## Your first form

```ts
// Coming soon.
```

## Running the demo

If you want to explore the library without any setup, you can run [the demo](./demo/) by cloning the repository and running:

```
npm run ci-demo
npm run demo
```

If you want to explore the demo code, a good place to start would be [the form root](./demo/src/MyForm/MyForm.tsx).

## Extensions

This is how the extension model works:

```ts
Coming soon...
