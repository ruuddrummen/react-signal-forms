# React Signal Forms

> **Note.** This library is brand new and under heavy development. You can follow its progress at the [development project](https://github.com/users/ruuddrummen/projects/1). Everything is still subject to change.  We're only just getting started.

A forms library which aims to provide a high performance modular and extensible experience by leveraging the power of signals with [@preact/signals-react](https://github.com/preactjs/signals).

- Easy to use, easy to extend. Built from the ground with an DX friendly extension model.
  - Pick and choose what you need.
  - Plug in your own.
- Add rules to your fields.
  - Like `isRequired()` or `applicableIf(...)`.
  - Rules have access to your form context and other fields.
- Only calculates and renders what is necessary by leveraging signals.
- Bring your own UI libraries and components.
- Everything is strongly typed with Typescript.
- And many more smart and useful quotes.

To get started install the package with npm:

```
npm i react-signal-forms

## Running the demo

If you want to explore the library without any setup, you can run [the demo](./demo/) by cloning the repository and running:

```
npm run ci-demo
npm run demo
```

If you want to explore the demo code, a good place to start would be [the form root](./demo/src/MyForm.tsx).
